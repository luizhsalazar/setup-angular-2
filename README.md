Description
===========

This is a simple setup project for Angular 2 with a pretty simple example, followed through https://school.scotch.io/getting-started-with-angular-2 tutorial.

All these config files are needed based on the new way Angular 2 works with JS. 
Files "tsconfig.json", "typings.json" and "systemjs.config.js" are included in this project in order to make Angular 2 
able to run in all current browsers. As the new framework's implementation has been developed to support the new features inserted
in new release JS ES6, by now, all this configurations files are needed. In a near future (we hope), all the setup will be 
just include one "angular2.js" file into the project and have fun.

Usage
===========

```bash
$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Have fun!
